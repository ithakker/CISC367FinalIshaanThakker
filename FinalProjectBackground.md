## Rise of Cryptocurrencies


*Ishaan Thakker*


## Background


The creation of the first decentralised peer-to-peer payment system, Bitcoin, has led to the creation of a novel and booming set of payment services- known collectively as ‘cryptocurrencies’. These digital currencies are not created or backed by any government, nor does any one user have complete control over. The price movement is one which is not normal when buying assests such as stocks, bonds, or even metals. And this movement can be daunting for new people trying to get into this space. Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, there are over 4000 different cryptocurrencies with the total market being valued at 2.23 trillion dollars. With so many options how can investors be sure that they are making the right decision when choosing to buy a specific currency? <sup> 1 <sup>

Like any currency, cryptocurrencies gain their value based on the scale of community involvement (like the user demand, scarcity or coin’s utility). In this digital age, it is important for people to have the right knowledge in this space to be able to make a smart investment and limit risk. The future is bright for blockchain and crypto and could soon enough be a centralized way of payment, but before that is reached, mainstream knowledge has to be spread.

## Research Questions


1. Which currencies have a leading position in the market?
2. How can daily return of cryptocurrencies be modeled with distributions?
3. What is the best currency to buy?
4. How can risk be managed when investing in crypto?

These questions are the general topics that I wish to explore but as I do more research they might subject to change.


## Justification


Just like any investment, people should have the right knowledge when putting their hard earned money into something that they hope to have positive returns. Since crypto is a fairly new concept for most people I am hoping that my anaysis can shed some light on the fundamentals of crypto.

## Dataset:


[Kaggle Dataset for All Cryptocurrencies](https://www.kaggle.com/jessevent/all-crypto-currencies)


A historic open, high, low, close, values for all cryptocurrencies (as of May 2018)


## Ethical Concerns


The ethical concerns relating to this problem are actually quite significant. First, people should never take anyones research and base it as their own when deciding to invest. It is important to learn key terms in the market before starting to invest. The research I will be doing only applies to my understand of crypto based on prior experience. That is not to say that people should not view my research it is simply to make sure each person does their own due diligence. Crytocurrency is by no means the safest investment and no one should allocate a large of there investment money into it. In terms of data, I this dataset is good but I has not been updated since 2018 but I feel like I will be able to get the answers to the questions that I want to explore.
